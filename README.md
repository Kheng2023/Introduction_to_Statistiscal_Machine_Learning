# Introduction to Statistical Machine Learning  

This repository contains assignments for the **Introduction to Statistical Machine Learning** course.

## Assignment 1: Mathematical Quiz (Not Included)  
- Focused on fundamental mathematical concepts relevant to machine learning.  

## Assignment 2: Support Vector Machine (SVM) from Scratch  
- Implemented **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** using **NumPy** and **cvxpy**.  
- Used **convex optimization** techniques for training the model.  

## Assignment 3: Unsupervised Learning â€“ PCA & K-Means Clustering  
- Implemented **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction.  
- Developed **K-Means Clustering** for unsupervised classification.  
- Used **NumPy** as the primary library for matrix operations and computations.
